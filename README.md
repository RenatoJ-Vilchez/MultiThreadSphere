# MultiThreadSphere
This is a C Language program to simulate on finding the volume of a sphere through a multi thread. 

In addition, this is simulated in a scenario of earning points in an arcade game based on the score of a game. 

Furthermore, getting a PI estimate allows a view of comparing to the actual volume of a sphere, which the formula is V = 4/3 πr³//
